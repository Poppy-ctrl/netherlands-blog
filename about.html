                        The thought of moving to another country is a fantasy many of us have entertained, even if only briefly after a particularly great holiday. Returning to the grind of your 9-5 back home 
                        (for me, that’s the UK) just seems dull in comparison to where you’ve been. Then there's that one acquaintance with the jealousy-inducing story of how they lived abroad and “found themselves” 
                        (I put that in quotes because I’m still not sure what that means!). But <strong>how</strong> do you actually move abroad? While many Brits consider Australia, what about our neighbor across the 
                        North Sea <strong>~the Netherlands~</strong> which feels just out of reach after Brexit? That’s where I come in.

                    Hi, I’m <strong>Poppy</strong>, a Brit who moved to the Netherlands in July 2024. I want to share everything I’ve learned as an expat here, to save you the research I had to do myself—and maybe help others affected by 
                    Brexit achieve their dream of moving abroad. My story starts during the Covid-19 lockdown with Discord (yes, slightly embarrassing). I had just graduated from university, ended a long-term relationship,
                    and felt isolated like so many of us did. I joined Discord to connect with people online, and a few months in, I met Jeroen (or "Jack," as he’s often called by non-Dutch speakers). We hit it off 
                    immediately. Talking to him felt natural and comfortable, and soon enough, I liked him. At the time, I told my best friend Lucy about Jack, but I wasn’t ready for a relationship. Besides, long-distance 
                    relationships—especially between countries—don’t work, right? But we had such a great time just chatting over video calls and texting all day (sorry to my first corporate job—I was texting my e-boyfriend 
                    in the lab instead of analysing samples). After six months, Jeroen flew to the UK to meet me in person, and it felt like we had known each other for years. Since then, we’ve been dating long-distance, 
                    shuttling between the UK and the Netherlands, learning each other’s cultures, and growing together as a couple. After nearly three years, in 2024, I decided it was time to move to the Netherlands. The 
                    visa process was intense, and I found very little guidance available, so I had to navigate it on my own, which took a lot of time and money. But trust me—it was worth every bit of effort.
